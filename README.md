Developed a parking system for Round 2
Please provide the file name along with the file name as the input.

Rest of the input is taken from the input.txt.

--- Logic used --
I have used hashmaps to store and retrieve the slots and its corresponding vehicle number.
To go further, I have used hashmaps to also create a link between the vehicle number(key) and the age of the driver (value).
Whenever user enters or leaves the parking lot, the hashmap is updated accordingly.

I have added comments for every function's purpose.
